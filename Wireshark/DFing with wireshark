Signal hunting in Wireshark has a simple workflow to follow that allows for easy identification 
and tracking of target devices. First, we put a Wi-Fi network adapter into monitor mode and begin
scanning for targets with airodump-ng to locate the channel our target is on. Once we know the channel 
our target is broadcasting, 
we can scan only on that channel to get the maximum number of packets for plotting in Wireshark.

After locking onto the correct channel, we can open Wireshark, identify a packet from the device we 
want to track, and then create a display filter to only show transmissions from that Wi-Fi device. 
Finally, we use Wireshark's I/O graph to plot the signal strength over time as we move the directional 
antenna around the room, looking for spikes in signal strength.
