Analyst: analyst1

Description: Traveresed through the 10.45.117./24 to get to the 192.168.117./24 network.
Did device surveys on the internal network.
determined potential for follow on opperation value.
T1 was the External Router to the network, only had remote logging and selinux in permissive.
T2 is a server with remote logging and selinux enforced.
T3 was the internal router, scanned from this device to find the ssh ports for the internal network.
T4 had malware on it leading me to suspect poor security and the box. it also had a lot of logs.
T5 had a admin acoun logged on locally using wireshark, one of the admins boxes.
T6 did not reach.
T7 did not reach.


Result: Fail
Too many point deductions
-did not access T6,T7
No T4,T5 analyst objectives
No wireshark report (separate report required)
T1 disconnect time missing from opnotes

Operation: DR04

MC: MC1

Analyst: analyst1

Description: Goal of the operation was to collect files of interests. Mission was a failure, missed malware and did not hit every target. Operator traversed through 3 networks.
Admin was logged into the T2 running a logging software. T1 was the external router for the 10.145.117./24. T2 was a windows server that we had to use evil winrm to get into and redirected using netsh.
T3 was the internal router in to the 192.169.117./24 network. T4 conducted a device survey and pulled files of interest for analyst. T5 conducted a device survey, pulled files of interest for analyst, redirected using iptables.
T6 was supposed to be surveyed but ran out of time, had files of interest on it. T7 did not touch.
