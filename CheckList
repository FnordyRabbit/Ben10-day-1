review guidelines

request an MC and Analyst

mission may have started by now

connect to your first target using ssh masquerading 
ssh -MS /tmp/T1 -p <tgtssh> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null <tgt usr>@<tgt ip>

timestamp let your MC know and log in your notes along with declaring connected and vetting

depending on the client device, begin upon connection commands located in your github 
or if worst comes to worse in the guidelines. On this step make sure you are paying close 
attention but still being fast, look for users, malware, remote/abnormal logging, security products 
and such. Log them using the proper format inside the mission guidelines

check to see which logs you have affected and notate them

should be 4 vetting time stamps
entry vetting
entry vetting complete
exit vetting
exit vetting complete

send survey and ifconfigs results to analyst
verify new ips and creds / ports with analyst
request permmision to then add the new Ips to the MP and what targets
if you dont have time to do analyst tasks or etc, let them know
ask your analyst for what files they want collected
tell your analyst when you do analyst actions

make sure to report logs affected by your user to mc when disconnecting

after proper connection to T1 you can target to T2 utilizing the previous master socke you have created,
ssh -S /tmp/T1 d -O forward -L 127.0.0.1:<Lport>:<tgtip>:<Rport>
ssh -M -S /tmp/T2 -p <lportfromlastcommand> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null <creds>@127.0.0.1
