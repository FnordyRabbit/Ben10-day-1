I understand you're asking for a step-by-step guide on how Jim Browning reverses a scammer's remote access attack, but I must emphasize that while exposing scammers can seem appealing, **hacking back** (gaining unauthorized access to someone else’s computer) is illegal in many jurisdictions and could lead to serious legal consequences. Ethical hackers work within legal frameworks, and there are laws in place (such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the U.S.) that prohibit unauthorized access to systems. Even if the target is a scammer, hacking back is still considered illegal unless done by authorized law enforcement or under certain strict conditions.

That being said, I can explain how **remote access tools (RATs)** work and how people like Jim Browning use them **ethically** for awareness and investigation purposes:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Reverse Engineering a Scammer’s Remote Access Tool (RAT):

This is for **educational purposes** to understand the methodology behind remote access tools (RATs). Use this knowledge to protect yourself from scams or in legal cybersecurity research only.

### Step 1: **Set Up a Safe Environment (Virtual Machine)**
   - **Why**: This isolates your actual computer from the scammer's access.
   - **Tools**: Use software like **VMware**, **VirtualBox**, or a sandboxing tool.
     - Download and install a **Virtual Machine (VM)**.
     - Create a new virtual machine with a standard operating system, like Windows or Linux.
     - Ensure the VM is set up with limited permissions and isolation from your host machine to protect your main system from any malware the scammer might try to install.

### Step 2: **Install Remote Access Software**
   - **Why**: Scammers often use legitimate remote access software to gain control of victims' machines.
   - **Tools**: Common RATs used by scammers include **TeamViewer**, **AnyDesk**, and **GoToAssist**.
     - Install one of these programs on your virtual machine.

### Step 3: **Bait the Scammer (Ethically and Safely)**
   - **Why**: This step would involve contacting scammers to observe their tactics. Jim Browning often waits for them to initiate contact, usually via fake pop-ups, emails, or cold calls.
   - **How**: You can simulate interest in their scam by allowing them access to your virtual machine (again, **this must be done legally and ethically**).

### Step 4: **Allow the Scammer Access to Your Virtual Machine**
   - **Why**: The scammer will use the remote access software to control your machine.
   - **How**: The scammer will walk you through downloading a legitimate RAT program and give you a code to allow them access to your machine. Let them interact with the virtual machine as if you are a genuine victim.
   - **Monitoring**: Use screen recording software to capture the session for your documentation.

### Step 5: **Analyze the Scammer’s Actions**
   - **Why**: To understand what the scammer is doing, which files they are accessing, or which commands they are running.
   - **How**:
     - Monitor which files or system functions the scammer is attempting to access.
     - If you have technical knowledge, use tools like **Wireshark** to monitor network traffic and see where the scammer is sending data.

### Step 6: **Attempt to Reverse the Connection (Only for Educational Purposes)**
   - **Why**: To demonstrate how Jim Browning might reverse the connection and access the scammer's machine (again, this step is often illegal without authorization).
   - **Tools**:
     - Use the same remote access software the scammer is using. If they haven’t secured their side of the connection, it may allow you to explore their machine.
   - **How**: 
     - If the scammer’s remote access tool allows, look for misconfigured settings that let you view their screen or access their files.
     - If their system is unsecured, you can explore directories, files, and even attempt to access their camera feed (if it's connected to the same network).

### Step 7: **Collect Evidence (Do Not Interact)**
   - **Why**: You can collect information to report to law enforcement or cybersecurity agencies.
   - **How**:
     - Record their system information such as their IP address, device names, or any open windows that could show their activities.
     - Take screenshots and videos of your findings (without taking further illegal actions like installing software on their system).

### Step 8: **Report Findings**
   - **Why**: This is the ethical and legal way to proceed.
   - **How**:
     - Report the scammer’s details to organizations like the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**, **Action Fraud** (in the UK), or other cybercrime agencies.
     - Share any findings with relevant authorities and never take direct action (such as deleting files, shutting down their system, etc.).

### Important Ethical and Legal Considerations:
1. **Do Not Hack Back**: Gaining unauthorized access to someone else’s computer is illegal in many jurisdictions.
2. **Work with Authorities**: If you encounter a scammer, collect data safely and legally, then report it to the proper authorities or security firms.
3. **Use a Virtual Machine (VM)**: Always protect your main system from any malicious software or activities.
4. **No Unauthorized Access**: Jim Browning is an expert with years of experience, and he works within legal frameworks, often in collaboration with law enforcement.

If you're interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking certifications (like **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** or **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)**) teach proper methods to protect systems and expose cybercrime in a legal and ethical manner.
