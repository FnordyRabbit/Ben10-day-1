One of three profiles is activated automatically for each network interface:

Public assumes that the network is shared with the World and is the most restrictive profile.

Private assumes that the network is isolated from the Internet and allows more
inbound connections than public. A network is never assumed to be private unless 
designated as such by a local administrator.

Domain profile is the least restrictive. It allows more inbound connections to 
allow for file sharing etc. The domain profile is selected automatically when connected
to a network with a domain trusted by the local computer.

=================================================================================================

Security log capabilities are included, which can record IP addresses and other data relating to c
onnections originating from the home or office network or the Internet. It can record both dropped packets 
and successful connections. This can be used, for instance, to track every time a computer on the network
connects to a website. This security log is not enabled by default; the administrator must enable it.

Windows Firewall can be controlled/configured through a COM object-oriented API, scriptable through the
netsh command, through the GUI administration tool or centrally through group policies. All features are 
available regardless of how it is configured. 

==================================================================================================

netsh Overview

Netsh is a command-line scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely,
display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. 
Netsh also provides a scripting feature that allows you to run a group of commands in batch
mode against a specified computer. Netsh can also save a configuration script in a text file
for archival purposes or to help you configure other servers.

Syntax
netsh [-a AliasFile] [-c Context] [-r RemoteComputer] [{NetshCommand|-f ScriptFile}]

We will mainly be working with the Contexts interface and advfirewall.

==================================================================================================

netsh interface

Common Commands:
netsh interface show interface	- Display all network interfaces

ip Commands:
netsh interface ip show address	- Display IP Address; DHCP;Subnet; Gateway
netsh interface ip show dns		- Display DNS information on network interface

portproxy (Tunneling) Commands:
netsh interface portproxy show all
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=12345 listenaddress=192.168.0.221 connectport=54321 
connectaddress=192.168.0.98 protocol=tcp
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=12345 listenaddress=192.168.0.221

==================================================================================================

netsh advfirewall firewall

Common Commands:
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles  			- See if Windows Firewall is enabled
netsh advfirewall show currentprofile 			- Show which profiles are active
netsh advfirewall export "c:\FW.wfw" 			- Create a BACKUP of the configuration
netsh advfirewall import "c:\FW.wfw"  			- Restore netsh firewall configuration

firewall Commands:
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all 	- View firewall configuration

!!!!!!!!!!!INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

linda :: netsh interface portproxy show all

linda :: netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=<LRHP> listenaddress=<LIP> connectport=<tgtssh> connectaddress=<TgtIP> protocol=tcp
                                                      ^listen to itself
essentially just an ssh command



linda :: net interface portproxy show all
^used to check netsh tunnel is setup

kali ops now

kaliops :: ssh -S /tmp6/T8.ssh -O forward -L 8017:192.168.0.9:8007 dickingmacdown
this ssh command sends traffic to linda which then sends traffic to the target 
machine due to the previous netsh command.
