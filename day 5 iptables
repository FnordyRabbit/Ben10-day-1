configuring ip, nat and mangle tables again

  lsmod can be used to see what mods are loaded

  iptable s
  ====================================================

  lmsod (see if iptables is loaded)

  sudo iptables -t nat -L  (displaying iptables)


--dport is local port on tgt machine 
--to-destination tgtip:tgtssh
                                            
  sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <lclpt> -j DNAT --to-destination <ip>:sshport
  sudo iptables -t nat -L

  sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward  || or || cat /proct/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
(if neither gives 1 is not router)
              ||                                                                    (depends on which command worked)
              ===========================> (if not rtr then) sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 || or || echo 1 > /proct/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
Kaliboxnow# ssh to dport specified


can get annoying since you have to mannually create tunnels and mannually tunnels

say you wanna get to T3 but you have to use iptables
one rule for t1 -> t2  (one sepperate tunnel for T1 to T2 cannot reuse)
second rule for t2 ->3
third rule for t1 -> t2 -> t3












  sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j SNAT --tp-source <tgt>


sudo iptables -nvl
