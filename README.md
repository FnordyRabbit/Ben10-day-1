The main files you need to read are:

checklist

day 5 scanning

day 5 iptables

lin connect and survey

netsh

the nsdb premade files

rodgers helping me

win connect commands

win survey commands

win scp

==================================================

commands people struggle with are:

wmic (my breakdown of this command is in win connect commands)

scp from windows / linux machines

my linux scp is in rodgers helping me and my windows scp is in win scp.

making remote tunnles, my example of one is in the checklist at the bottom

plese make sure you read the NSDB, Guidance, and Daily Reads multiple times and that you constantly check the slides if you get stuck.
the slides have everything you need

using md5 recursivley for windows directories, i reccommend you use perplexity or github for the command.
