Start Time: ANYTIME
Duration: 6 hours
MC: mc1
Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst1

Type of Operation: TECHOP // Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Conduct TECHOP on T2 and T4. Operator will modify logs on targets to remove their logs from /var/log/[secure||auth.log] and /var/log/messages  created from MM2. Perform malware and logging analysis of listed user devices within the Drittes Reichâ€™s internal HYDRA network (192.168.0.1/24).  

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. All scanning must be conducted through secure tunnels. Nmap and traceroute command(s) are authorized but unreliable and known to produce false positives.

Credentials: root::<password_you_set> | administrator::<password_you_set> | student#::password#  // **administrators documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers and various other devices to enable incident response outsourcing

Prior Approvals: TECHOP will clear logs of T2 and T4 and utilize the touch command for timestamp changes. DO NOT modify binary files. Sudo is authorized ONLY for commands that require it unless otherwise instructed.
