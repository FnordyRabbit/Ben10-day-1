Duration: 6 hours

Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst1

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Perform enumeration of listed user devices within the Drittes Reichâ€™s internal HYDRA network (192.168.0.1/24).  Enumeration will consist of hostname, OS, local time/Zulu time; all network interfaces, listening ports, non-system processes, services, partitions, and resource usage (memory, CPU, and storage space). Of particular interest, record all user accounts for use in follow-on operations.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change.

Credentials: root::<password_you_set> | administrator::<password_you_set> | student#::password#  // **administrators documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers and various other devices to enable incident response outsourcing

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized ONLY for commands that require it unless otherwise instructed.
