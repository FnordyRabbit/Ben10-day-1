TODAY
Start Time: ANYTIME
Duration: 6 hours
MC: mc1
Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst1

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Tunnel through devices within the Drittes Reichâ€™s internal HYDRA network (192.168.0.1/24) by utilizing SSH control sockets for obfuscation.  

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change.

Credentials: student#::password#  // **administrators documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers and various other devices to enable incident response outsourcing

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized ONLY for commands that require it unless otherwise instructed.

Scheme of Maneuver:
>T1: <FLOAT_IP>
->T2: 192.168.0.13
--<T3: 192.168.0.9
->T4: 192.168.0.27
-->T5: 192.168.0.23
-->T6: 192.168.0.10

Target Section:

T1 >>External Router<<
Hostname: Louise
IP: <FLOAT_IP> / 192.168.0.99
OS: Linux
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: <ssh1>
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and redirect to the next target.


T2:
Hostname: Mort
IP: 192.168.0.13
OS: Linux
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: <ssh1>
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade. Use tunnels to redirect the beacon from T3 on port 123## to capture on your opstation on the same port. You will need to establish a netcat listener on your opstation with the following command: nc -nvlp 123##.


T3:
Hostname: Unknown
IP: 192.168.0.9
OS: Unknown
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: <ssh1>
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Receive beacon from T3. You will not go interactive on this target.


T4:
Hostname: Teddy
IP: 192.168.0.27
OS: Linux
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: <ssh1>
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade to verify connectivity and redirect to the next target.


T5:
Hostname: Bob
IP: 192.168.0.23
OS: Linux
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: <ssh1>
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade to verify connectivity.


T6:
Hostname: Gene
IP: 192.168.0.10
OS: Linux
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: <ssh1>
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
