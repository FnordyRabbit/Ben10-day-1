MAIN THINGS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT


Logged in Privileged Users

Malware

Logging (kind of)

Security Products

System resource usage

===============================================

  date and time

  date /t

  time /t 

  DO NOT RUN EITHER COMMANDS BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE OPTION

  ================================================

System Information
  
  Windows provides the “systeminfo” command providing a lot of
relevant system enumeration information. The following information,
and more, can be gained from the command:

Device name

OS version

CPU and architecture

System uptime

Installed RAM and usage

NIC information

To check the load on the cpu/processor:

wmic cpu get loadpercentage

===============================================

DISK USAGE

To check disk information on a Windows system:

wmic logicaldisk get name (displays local drives)

To display available space, simply use dir on the drive and it
will list the available space at the bottom of the results

dir c:\

Why does available space matter? becuase you dont want to blow up the hardrive if its already incredibly strained for memory

  ============================================

  MACHINE IDENTIFICATION

  ipconfig /all
-
displays the status of the currently active interfaces

hostname -
display the system's hostname, not the domain name

echo %userdomain% - displays the current domain name

Systeminfo - already discussed

======================================================

  PROCESSES

tasklist [options]

=====================================================

 OPEN PORTS/CONNECTIONS 

To view a list of listening ports and open connections, you can use the netstat
command:

Netstat [options]

/a - Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on
which the computer is listening

/b - Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or listening
port. (requires elevated permissions)

/n - Displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers
are expressed numerically and no attempt is made to determine names.

/o - Displays active TCP connections and includes the process ID (PID) for
each connection.

  ===================================================

  Files

It is important to know your surroundings relative to your current position. When
we enter a Windows system, we are placed into a file structure known as a
directory. (By default, the ‘home’ directory of the user you are logging in as.) In
order to better understand the files and the file structure itself, certain
commands are utilized:

dir <file>List information about file(s)

dir
Briefly list directory contents

cd
Change Directory

type
Concatenate and print (display) the content of files

more
Display output one screen at a time

strings
Output the strings of printable characters in a file (if installed)

findstr
Search file(s) for lines that match a given pattern

  ============================================================

  
  registrys 
  main registrys to be worried about are hlcu hlcm
  =======================================================
  doskey commands are reportable


  =============================================================

VERY useful information present here that is not available via cmd.exe

Powershell can also get the information but it can cause lots of logs on the latest versions

REQUIRES the “Windows Management Instrumentation” or “Winmgmt” service to be
running

This service is set to “Auto” or “2” meaning that if you invoke it then you will cause the service to
start!

Question: How would you check to see if this was already running?

Invoked via the “wmic” command

Extensive help menu with many sub-menus

Can acquire more information about the computer faster and easier

Process list with ParentProcessIDs, ExecutablePaths, CommandLine arguments and more? Yes
please!

  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!POWERSHELL BY DEFAULT LOGS EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TRY TO AVOID USING IF POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WMIC CAN TYPICALLY GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ASK GUNNY GOOGLE FOR HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!USE MULTIPLE COMMNANDS IN WINDOWS DONT RELY ON JUST ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

==================================================================

Logging

It is likely, almost guaranteed, you have logged on the device
in some way. When assessing risk to the mission, an operator
needs to be aware of what logs are being generated and what
kind of “footprint” they will potentially leave behind.

Most of the known risk will be evaluated, mitigated, and/or
assumed beforehand. Unfortunately, you cannot plan for
everything, so as an operator you must be able to make
assessments and report the risk appropriately.

Logging will be covered in greater detail later

==============================================================

Fun Surprises

Unfortunately, you will make some kind of change to the device, whether
it is known or unknown is important for operations. As we previously
mentioned, logs will update and MACs will change however, there are
other changes you must be aware of. Such changes may include, and are
not limited to:

Creating files

Modifying system configurations

Firewall rules

Stopping or starting services

Not addressing the risk could potentially lead to an admin, or even worse
another actor, discovering and compromising your position and activity!
