Reporting Security Product Guidelines

Students will follow the below guidelines when reporting security products to the MC. All reports will include the information in the template below.

    Name and version of the product
    Installation folder
    Directory location of associated logs
    Timestamp of all associated log files
    Cloud based?; yes or no
    Can we read the logs?; yes or no

    If Yes, put the most recent 5 lines of logs in your NSDB File
    If No, why?

Commands

Vetting Commands

During every operation, operators will be required to vet every device they connect to and conduct a minimal OPSEC review before disconnecting from a device. Not running one of the commands (or their equivalent), detailed below, will result in a penalty. Students will not utilize scripts to automatically run all of these commands (or redirect a script through their secure tunnel). Command options can be added to, but not subtracted from each command. Use of unauthorized scripts is prohibited and will result in automatic failure of the operation. For all commands that specify OR, attempt the initial command first.

Windows

Upon Connection:

    date /t
    time /t
    query user
    tasklist /V
    auditpol /get /category:*
    ipconfig /all
    netstat /anob
    netsh advfirewall show allprofiles

    dir /o:d /t:w "%appdata%\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup"
    wevtutil qe security /c:25 /rd:true /f:text (whatever has updated from previous dir)

    dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs
    wevtutil qe security /c:25 /rd:true /f:text (whatever has updated from previous dir)

ls -latr /tmp
ls -latr .
ls -latr ..
ls -latr /root
ps -elf
ifconfig -a OR ip addr
netstat -auntp OR ss -auntp

ls -latr /var/spool/cron

    tail -n 1000 <files in /var/spool/cron/>

    date; date -u
    uname -a
    df
    ls -latr /var/*/*acc*
    ls -latr /var/*log*/
    ls -latr /var/log/*

    cat out relevant files (grep for your logged in user account)

    ls -la /etc/*syslog* read all the config files
    for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do echo "###### $user crontab is:"; cat /var/spool/cron/{crontabs/$user,$user} 2>/dev/null; done
    cat /etc/crontab
    ls -la /etc/cron.*

    As needed, examine the files/scripts shown in the directory listing of the cron.* directories

    find / \( -path /proc -prune -o -path /sys -prune \) -o -mmin -<duration in minutes since initial connection> -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -latr (NOTE there is a "-" a.k.a minus symbol preceding the "<duration in minutes since initial connection">
    sestatus OR getenforce
    cat /root/.bash_history
    cat ~/.bash_history

Before Disconnect:

    w
    ls -latr /tmp

    ls -latr /var/log
    find / \( -path /proc -prune -o -path /sys -prune \) -o -mmin -<yourminutesontarget> -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -latr

Analyst Survey Commands

Some operations will call for the student to conduct an analyst-survey on a device. Students will not utilize scripts to automatically run these commands (or redirect a script through their secure tunnel). Below are the list of commands required during an analyst-survey for operations. Command options can be added to, but not subtracted from each command. Note that survey commands may also be useful in finding more information about suspected malware. Students will copy the commands and output into a separate file in their STUDENT DIRECTORY named "Survey_<IP_Address>".

    Include an operator recommendation for every nonstandard report (what you think we should do with that target/mission)

Survey Notes

    Start and end timestamps of "Analyst Survey Commands"
