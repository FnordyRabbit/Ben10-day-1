cd into STUDENT DIRECTORY

Create an opnotes file with: vim notes_<dd-mm-yy>

Why Op Notes?

Op notes are an technically focused document used as reference during the mission, and after the
mission. These notes provide notable information and details another operator may use as reference
when next accessing the device or to provide quick details in case of some form of review.

Do Record:

Mission start/end time

Time of each connection to and
disconnection from each target

Start and end timestamps of "Upon
Connection" and "Before Disconnect"
vetting command sections

File hashes

Device identifiers (mac/IP/hostnames…)

Nonstandard references

Unusual/Unexpected target information

Do Not Record:

Names

Titles (i.e. SFC or Cpt)

Positions (i.e. SWO or Analyst)

Any reference to a group (i.e. “Permission
granted to ….”)

Personal IDs (i.e. SIDs)

Any other non-target identifiers
