Event Logs - Windows Logs

Application log
The Application log contains events logged by applications or programs. For example, a database program might record a file error in the application log. Program developers decide which events to log.
Security log
The Security log contains events such as valid and invalid logon attempts, as well as events related to resource use, such as creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects. Administrators can specify what events are recorded in the security log. For example, if you have enabled logon auditing, attempts to log on to the system are recorded in the security log.
Setup log
The Setup log contains events related to application setup.
System log
The System log contains events logged by Windows system components. For example, the failure of a driver or other system component to load during startup is recorded in the system log. The event types logged by system components are predetermined by Windows.
