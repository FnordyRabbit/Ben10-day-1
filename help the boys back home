T10 Basic Operator Course

Graded Practicals Guidelines v19

Course Rules

Students are not permitted to discuss any portion of these practicals with other students via any communication method. Students must take the steps required below, even if they overhear a conversation about the same topic. Students are only permitted to speak to identified instructors/facilitators while plans and operations are being conducted. Students are NOT permitted to log into the Instructors Admin Box.

Any violation of these rules will result in immediate failure of the course.

Students will be provided with one Kali OpStation in which all practice ops and graded evaluations will be conducted from. Every single thing you do will be done from your opstation or an approved Listening Post (LP). At no point should you run ssh/scp commands from a target machine. SSH control sockets are the only means of tunneling that students will use during these evaluations. Students will complete all 8 evaluations to the best of their abilities; there will be no 'taking a knee' or 'tapping out'. (Note: Special circumstances do happen and will be handled accordingly).

SPECIAL NOTE: Students will NOT remove, alter, or unset their bash history on any target. This is for grading purposes.

Throughout evaluations, Students will be evaluated on the following Basic Operator Tasks:

    Conduct open-source research via various online resources

    Researching unfamiliar tools, binaries, or processes for triage and usage purposes

    Process exfiltrated data into appropriate databases and/or systems

    Uploading all operational data properly, using correct naming and archiving conventions.

    Record and document activities during cyberspace operations

    Recording mission start time, end time, time of each connection to each target,and timestamping vetting start/end in opnotes
    Reporting connection or disconnection to a device

Not having "dirty words" in opnotes.

    Identify the appropriate operating authorities and guidance

    Following information provided by MC, instructors and/or evaluators

    This includes adhering to mission start and end times as well as waiting for acknowlegement on non-standard reports.

    Pre-operational research and prep

    Adhering to specific instructions for a device or network in the mission plan (ex: plan says don't access the device on a specific port, or don't run a particular survey command due to logging)
    Follow any guidance on the 'Daily Reads,â€™ Guidelines, NSDB, Mission Plan or other prescribed guidance.

    Conduct Pre-Mission Actions

    Follow before and after operation steps
    Verify IPs with MC prior to op

    IPs discovered during operation need to be approved for access by MC
    Ahdere to the approved scheme of maneuver

    Provide input to mission debrief

    Provide detailed DEBRIEF after operation

    Conduct post-mission actions

    Follow before and after operation steps
    Must have full malware, security product, abnormal logging reports in NSDB File

    Maintain operational and technical situational awareness during operations

    Do not collect, redirect, conducting the Analyst Survey, or take any other target actions before 'clearing' the target

    This means reporting any risk (i.e. Security products, abnormal logging, malware, or privileged users) and waiting for MC guidance.

    Identify targets of opportunity in order to influence operational planning

    Inform the analyst of files of interest, previously unknown processes, vulnerabilities, devices, or networks.
    Get authorization prior to taking any action not identified in the mission plan

    Recognize and respond to indicators of compromise (IOC)

    Avoid leaving indicators of compromise such as any changes to a system, leaving files on disk behind or removing files without authorization
    Identify and fully report possible malware to MC during the operation such as:

    Non-standard scripts running
    Actual malware to include rootkits

    Identify and fully report abnormal/irregular logging to MC during the operation such as:

    Remote logging
    Process accounting
    Non-standard network monitoring software
    Anything else that could log actions on target

    Recognize and respond to events that change risk

    Identify and fully report logged in users and their activities to MC during the operation.

    NOTE: You will ignore other students' activities.

    Identifying and fully report Security Products installed on the device to MC during the operation such as:

    SELinux/AppArmor
    Anti-Virus Software
    Active firewall

    Employ collection/exfiltration TTPs in cyberspace operations

    Complete and notify the analyst of completion of an analyst action after accessing device
    Adhering to Filesize Guidance

    Employ lateral movement TTPs in cyberspace operations

    Manuever through the network at an acceptable pace to reach and complete actions on each target
    Provide required interface information to analyst upon connection
    Ensure that you do not lose connection due to Operator action
    Do not maintain simultaneous connections to targets that use the same pivot once they are no longer required
    Report connect and disconnect to MC for each target

    Employ discovery TTPs in cyberspace operations

    Complere and notify analyst of completion of an analyst action after accessing device

    Identify and report all requested information (IP, OS, ports).

    Employ credential access TTPs in cyberspace operations

    Avoid mistyping credentials or utilizing incorrect targets credentials
    Avoid authenticating more than once to a target

    Conduct survey of computer and digital networks

    Complete and notify analyst of completion of survey after accessing device
    Students will create a separate file for every device they survey with the full output of the survey commands. Naming convention will be "Survey_<IP_Address>".
    Run all of your vetting commands, or their equivalent, on every target. Each target needs their own termscreen. Do not reuse terminals.

    Conduct cyber activities to deny, degrade, disrupt, destroy, manipulate (D4M)

    Avoid performing unauthorized D4M actions, such as placing the device in an unusable or inaccessible state - shutdown / reboot, firewall, etc., whether intentional or unintentional.
    Properly deliver the desired T10 effect (to include accessing the intended device)
    Verify T10 effect with MC before delivery, and timestamping in notes

For each evaluation students must successfully complete 80% of all instances for each evaluated task without performing any violations in order to pass a given operation. Items in red represent violations.


Students must also pass five out of eight evaluated operations to be considered for course graduation. (Passing 5 of 8 evaluated operations does NOT guarantee course graduation.). If students pass 4 evaluated operations and have an overall average of 80% or higher in each task, they will receive a remediation operation to attempt a fifth successful operation. If a student passes 5 evaluated operations, however fails to achieve an overall course grade of 80% or higher, they will be given a remediation operation to attempt to achieve 80%.

ENVIRONMENT PREP

Before the Operation

Below are the requirements of the Operator before conducting an operation. Failure to do so may result in immediate failure.

    Review mission plan

Commands

Vetting Commands

During every operation, operators will be required to vet every device they connect to and conduct a minimal OPSEC review before disconnecting from a device. Not running one of the commands (or their equivalent), detailed below, will result in a penalty. Students will not utilize scripts to automatically run all of these commands (or redirect a script through their secure tunnel). Command options can be added to, but not subtracted from each command. Use of unauthorized scripts is prohibited and will result in automatic failure of the operation. For all commands that specify OR, attempt the initial command first.

Analyst Survey Commands

Some operations will call for the student to conduct an analyst-survey on a device. Students will not utilize scripts to automatically run these commands (or redirect a script through their secure tunnel). Below are the list of commands required during an analyst-survey for operations. Command options can be added to, but not subtracted from each command. Note that survey commands may also be useful in finding more information about suspected malware. Students will copy the commands and output into a separate file in their STUDENT DIRECTORY named "Survey_<IP_Address>".
